I have experience working with Swift, Objective C and SwiftUI for iOS app development. My experience includes working on Banking, multimedia apps, e-commerce domain applications. 

Staying updated on all the latest developments and trends. I have extensive knowledge of modern iOS design patterns and the experience needed to ensure excellent performance and a great user experience with all new designs. 

I pay close attention to details to ensure accuracy and to help create elegant new designs.
